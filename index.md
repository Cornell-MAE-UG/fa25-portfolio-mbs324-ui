## About Me

Hello! My name is Matthew Steiglitz, and I am a senior in mechanical engineering at Cornell University. I plan to graduate with a BS degree in May 2026. I am most interested in aerospace and manufacturing, but open to other industries as well. In university, my studies and extracurricular activities focused on aerospace engineering, mainly the design and manufacture of air and space craft. While I also learned about automotive, structural, and thermal engineering, my project experience was in aeronautics. I am also interested in interdisciplinary collaboration and the intersection of engineering with other fields. 

In my free time, I like to read, watch movies, listen to music, and spend time with friends. I also like to learn about the sciences, geography, history, and art.
